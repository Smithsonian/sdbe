  abstract = {A new digital back end (DBE) is being commissioned on Mauna Kea. The 
``SMA Wideband Astronomical ROACH2 Machine'', or SWARM,
processes a 4 GHz usable band in single polarization mode and is
flexibly reconfigurable for 2 GHz full Stokes dual polarization. The
hardware is based on the open source Reconfigurable Open Architecture
Computing Hardware 2 (ROACH2) platform from the Collaboration for
Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER). A 5 GSps
quad-core analog-to-digital converter board uses a commercial chip from
e2v installed on a CASPER-standard printed circuit board designed by
Homin Jiang's group at ASIAA. Two ADC channels are provided per
ROACH2, each sampling a 2.3 GHz Nyquist band generated by a custom
wideband block downconverter (BDC). The ROACH2 logic includes
16k-channel Polyphase Filterbank (F-engine) per input followed by a 10
GbE switch based corner-turn which feeds into correlator-accumulator
logic (X-engines) co-located with the F-engines. This arrangement makes
very effective use of a small amount of digital hardware (just 8 ROACH2s
in 1U rack mount enclosures). The primary challenge now is to meet
timing at full speed for a large and very complex FPGA bit code. Design
of the VLBI phased sum and recorder interface logic is also in process.
Our poster will describe the instrument design, with the focus on the
particular challenges of ultra wideband signal processing. Early
connected commissioning and science verification data will be presented.},

  title = {Digital sampling rate conversion principles and implementation},
  abstract = {The resampling of a signal involves the conversion from the initial sampling rate to a new and different one. This is often necessary in practical applications because the sampling rate is often fixed while the desired sampling rate may depend on the application or a signal parameter, such as the symbol rate or channel spacing. This problem often arises in software radio systems where the sampling rate is determined by hardware constraints. Although resampling algorithms have been developed and implemented in commercial software libraries, these algorithms often have undesirable limitations. This report describes a fairly general resampling algorithm useful in many practical signal processing applications. To obtain flexibility, it implements a periodically time varying filter structure in such a way that it keeps track of state variables and also makes provisions for input blocks of arbitrary length. The algorithm also achieves a relatively high processing throughput when implemented in software.},

Firstly, based on product theorem for the FRFT, the sampling theorems and reconstruction formulas are derived, which explain how to sample a continuous-time signal to obtain its discrete-time version for band limited signals in the fractional Fourier domain. Secondly, the formulas and significance of decimation and interpolation are studied in the fractional Fourier domain. Using the results, the sampling rate conversion theory for the FRFT with a rational fraction as conversion factor is deduced, which illustrates how to sample the discrete-time version without aliasing. The theorems proposed in this study are the generalizations of the conventional versions for the Fourier transform. Finally, the theory introduced in this paper is validated by simulations.},

  abstract = {A numerical investigation into the accuracy of interpolation by, fast Fourier transform (FFT), using a sinusoidal test signal, is described. The method is precisely defined, including a previously unnoticed detail which makes a significant difference to the accuracy of the result. The experiments show that, with no input windowing, the accuracy of interpolation is almost independent of sinusoidal wavelength very close to the Nyquist limit. The resulting RMS error is inversely proportional to input sequence length and is very low for sequence lengths likely to be encountered in practice. As wavelength passes through the Nyquist limit, there is a sudden increase in error, as is expected from sampling theory. If the sequence ends are windowed by short, cosine half-bells, accuracy is further improved at longer wavelengths. In comparison, small-kernal convolution methods, such as linear interpolation and cubic convolution, perform badly at wavelengths anywhere near the Nyquist limit},

Signals are processed in software instead of custom-built hardware, taking advantage of the flexibility that software solutions offer. In turn, the data rates are high and the processing requirements challenging. GPUs and multi-core processors are promising devices to provide the required processing power. LOFAR1, the largest radio telescope, is a prime example of a software radio telescope. In this paper, we discuss an optimized implementation of the polyphase filter bank used by LOFAR. We compare the following architectures: Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GTX580, ATI HD5870, and MicroGrid{[}7].

  abstract = {Provides a tutorial overview of multichannel wireless digital receivers and the relationships between channel bandwidth, channel separation, and channel sample rate. The overview makes liberal use of figures to support the underlying mathematics. A multichannel digital receiver simultaneously down-converts a set of frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM) channels residing in a single sampled data signal stream. In a similar way, a multichannel digital transmitter simultaneously up-converts a number of baseband signals to assemble a set of FDM channels in a single sampled data signal stream. The polyphase filter bank has become the architecture of choice to efficiently accomplish these tasks. This architecture uses three interacting processes to assemble or to disassemble the channelized signal set. In a receiver, these processes are an input commutator to effect spectral folding or aliasing due to a reduction in sample rate, a polyphase M-path filter to time align the partitioned and resampled time series in each path, and a discrete Fourier transform to phase align and separate the multiple baseband aliases. In a transmitter, these same processes operate in a related manner to alias baseband signals to high order Nyquist zones while increasing the sample rate with the output commutator.},

  abstract = {We describe the development of an FX-style correlator for very long 
baseline interferometry (VLBI), implemented in software and intended to
run in multiprocessor computing environments, such as large clusters of
commodity machines (Beowulf clusters) or computers specifically designed
for high-performance computing, such as multiprocessor shared-memory
machines. We outline the scientific and practical benefits for VLBI
correlation, these chiefly being due to the inherent flexibility of
software and the fact that the highly parallel and scalable nature of
the correlation task is well suited to a multiprocessor computing
environment. We suggest scientific applications where such an approach
to VLBI correlation is most suited and will give the best returns. We
report detailed results from the Distributed FX (DiFX) software
correlator running on the Swinburne supercomputer (a Beowulf cluster of
{\textasciitilde}300 commodity processors), including measures of the performance of the
system. For example, to correlate all Stokes products for a 10 antenna
array with an aggregate bandwidth of 64 MHz per station, and using
typical time and frequency resolution, currently requires an order of
100 desktop-class compute nodes. Due to the effect of Moore's law on
commodity computing performance, the total number and cost of compute
nodes required to meet a given correlation task continues to decrease
rapidly with time. We show detailed comparisons between DiFX and two
existing hardware-based correlators: the Australian Long Baseline Array
S2 correlator and the NRAO Very Long Baseline Array correlator. In both
cases, excellent agreement was found between the correlators. Finally,
we describe plans for the future operation of DiFX on the Swinburne
supercomputer for both astrophysical and geodetic science.},

We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data DFTs of prime size, a new way of implementing DFTs by means of machine-specific single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a DFT algorithm.},

  abstract = {Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based computations can be far more accurate than the  slow transforms suggest.  Discrete Fourier transforms computed through the FFT are  far more accurate than slow transforms, and convolutions  computed via FFT are far more accurate than the direct results.  However, these results depend critically on the accuracy  of the FFT software employed, which should generally be considered suspect.  Popular recursions for fast computation of the sine/cosine  table (or twiddle factors) are inaccurate due to inherent instability.  Some analyses of these recursions that have appeared heretofore  in print, suggesting stability, are incorrect.  Even in higher dimensions, the FFT is remarkably stable.},
